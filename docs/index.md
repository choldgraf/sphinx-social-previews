# Sphinx Social Cards

Automatically generate social media cards for your Sphinx documentation.

This extension will automatically generate a social media card with Matplotlib, using your site's title, logo, page title, and the first content from a given page.

This package depends on [`sphinxext-opengraph`](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/sphinxext-opengraph), which allows you to embed OpenGraph metadata in your Sphinx website.

See the sections below for more information.
