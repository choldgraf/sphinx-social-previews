# Sphinx Social Previews

A lightweight Sphinx extension to generate social media card preview images using page metadata.

> **Note** This is experimental!
>
> I hope to upstream this functionality into the [sphinxext-opengraph extension](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/sphinxext-opengraph).
> I'm using this repository to demonstrate and let people try it out.
